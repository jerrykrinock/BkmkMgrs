Accessors generated dynamically by Core Data for \hyperlink{class_stark}{Stark} managed objects.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Accessors generated dynamically by Core Data for \hyperlink{class_stark}{Stark} managed objects. 

These to-many accessors, which I do not implement because they are dynamically generated at runtime by Core Data, must be declared in a category with no implementation. If declared in, for example, the class warnings that their implementations are missing. \href{http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2008/8/10/215317}{\tt http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2008/8/10/215317} 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{CompactItemize}
