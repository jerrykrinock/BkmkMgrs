## User Defaults and Secret Key Combinations

/* This will cause files of SheepSafariHelper logs to be written to
~/Desktop/Bkmx-SheepSafariHelper-Logs. */
defaults write com.sheepsystems.SheepSafariHelper logVerbosity 5

/* This will cause files of log messages produced by methods
-[Ixporter merge…], -[Gulper gulp…] and their friends to be written to
~/Desktop/Bkmx-Ixport-Traces.  It will also cause JSON text of bookmarks
trees received from browser to be written to
~/Desktop/Bkmx-Trees-From-Clients. */
defaults write com.sheepsystems.BookMacster debugTraceVerbosity 5
/* You can also get this behavior on a one-time basis by holding down the
'alternate' and 'shift' keys as the ixport begins.  */

/* This will cause files of hash components (change for each bookmark!) to be
written to ~/Desktop/Bkmx-Hash-Components, and also additional summary
entries in the Logs. */
defaults write com.sheepsystems.BookMacster debugIxportHashes -bool YES

/* To enable relaxedExtensionDetection, which ignores detected extension
version numbers and always enables the "Install" buttons, hold down
shift+option+command while opening the Manage Browser Extensions window.
The behavior will persist until the app is quit. */
