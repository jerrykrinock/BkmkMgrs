Since the Collection was BookMacster's only facility for syncing identifiers, this means that, in the new design, identifiers for the same item, in the same Client, but on different Macs, will now *always* be different, except for possible coincidences in browsers like Chrome and Firefox, which use serial numbers instead of universal unique identifiers as Safari, Camino and Opera do.  Now, this new design appears to have the disadvantage of dissociating items if browsers' bookmarks files are synced behind BookMacster's back by some other service.  Dissociation means that any BookMacster-specific attributes such as *Don't sort this folder*, *Allowed Duplicate*, *Don't Verify", and attributes such as dates, *Description*, *Keyword*, *Rating*, etc. which are supported by some but not all Client browsers would be lost.  If re-imported, dissociated bookmarks and folders appear to the Collection as new items, never before seen.  However, I have verified that none of Google's Chrome Syncing, Xmarks, and MobileMe Safari bookmarks syncing preserve identifiers, so this dissociation would occur anyhow.  And if the user correctly treats their Collection as their *master* or *truth*, and, after syncing browsers' bookmarks files behind BookMacster's back, first executes an *export* before  *import*, then nothing will be lost.
