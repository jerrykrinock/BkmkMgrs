In addition to importing content from browsers and files, cut/copy/pasting and dragging between BookMacster [Collection](bkmxDoc)() documents, you can create new [content items]() from scratch in the following ways.
		
* **From scratch**. To create a new item, you may optionally select a "parent" or "sibling" where you would like it to appear, then click <img src="images/AddNew.png" alt="" /> and select the type of item you would like to add.  Alternatively, you can add a folder, bookmark or separator from the *Edit* menu

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="images/AddNewMenuItems.png" alt="" />
</div>

* **From *.webloc* files**. You can drag and drop in, from Finder, one or more Safari .webloc files, and we will create new bookmark(s) from them.  You can also drag and drop in, from Finder, folder(s) and/or subfolder(s) of .webloc files.   The Finder folders and subfolders  will become soft folders and subfolders of bookmarks.  The file and folder creation dates become the Date Added and Last Modified Date of the created bookmarks and folders.

***.webloc*** files are created by dragging a url from Safari's url field to the desktop or a Finder window.  They are called *web location* files.  Apple changed the format of .webloc in Safari version 5 (macOS 10.7), and again in Safari version 9 (macOS 10.11).  Current versions of our apps only support these two recent formats.  If you have some really old .webloc files (with *resource forks*), produced by Safari version 4 (macOS 10.6) or earlier, they will not drop into current versions of our apps.

* **From Safari's address and search field**.  You can create a bookmark to a web page you are viewing in Safari by dragging in the icon (favicon) which appears in Safari at the left edge of the *address and search field*.

* **From Safari's *Show [All] Bookmarks***. You can copy a bookmark or whole folder of bookmarks by dragging in an item from Safari's *Show [All] Bookmarks* bookmarks manager.

* **From text in other applications**.  The app accepts drags of text in a in the format you have specified in the [Text Copy Template]() preference.
