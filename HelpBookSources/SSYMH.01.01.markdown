# Getting Started with Smarky <img src="images/Smarky.png" alt="" class="whapp" /> [startSmarky]

Follow the steps below.  If you click a link for more detail, use the Back (<) button in the toolbar above to return here.

* Launch Smarky.  Smarky will automatically import your current bookmarks from Safari the first time you launch it.  If those have changed and you want to re-import the bookmarks you have now, click in the menu: *File* > *Import from Safari*.

* If you have other bookmarks in other files, browsers or [devices]() which you want to import and merge with what you have just imported, [copy all of them](oneTimeIxports) into Smarky.

* [Organize your bookmarks](organizingTasks).

* Check and be sure that the Content you now see in Smarky is what you want in Safari.

Smarky can keep your bookmarks in Safari sorted *automatically*.  It will watch for when you change bookmarks in Safari, or from iCloud, import the content, sort it, and export it.

**To enable syncing**

* Click the *Syncing* button in the toolbar to make *syncing* ready.  It will get a yellow dot like this…

</div>


* When prompted, click *Export*.

* Quit Smarky.  [Learn Why](leaveRunning).

* If desired, you may [test syncing](testSyncersSmarky).

**To finish without enabling syncing**

* Click in the menu: *File* > *Export to Safari*.  You should consider, but ultimately approve of any warnings which appear.

* Click in the menu: *Smarky* > *Quit Smarky*.
