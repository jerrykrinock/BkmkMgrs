In addition to automatic sorting and syncing of browsers' bookmarks, and collecting new bookmarks and visiting bookmarks directly, the app provides commands which you can invoke manually to organize your bookmarks.  These commands operate upon a [Collection](), and are particularly useful when you have initially created and populated such a document by importing from old, disparate bookmarks collections and need to organize them.
