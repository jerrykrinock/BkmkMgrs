# Switching to a Different App

SSYMH-PAGE-TOC

Knowing that more apps can mean more headaches, we have designed our apps so that you only need one.  Markster, Synkmark and Smarky each fulfill a specific narrow use case.  If you want capabilities of more than one of them, upgrade to BookMacster.  BookMacster can do anything which any of the other three apps can, except, of course, present a simpler user interface with fewer options.  But it is less complicated than using multiple apps.  Please use *only one* of BookMacster, Markter, Synkmark or Smarky.

You can switch between BookMacster and one of the other apps while keeping your .bmco bookmarks file.  Here are two examples:

## How to Switch from Synkmark to BookMacster 

If you have been using Synkmark but decide you want the increased capabilities of BookMacster,

* In Synkmark, switch syncing to *Paused*.
* Quit Synkmark.
* Download and install BookMacster.
* Run BookMacster.  Do not create a New Collection (`.bmco` file).  If it steers you into creating a New Collection, do not save the new Collection.  Close and Trash any new `.bmco` file which is created.
* Click in the menu: File > Open.  It will show you an empty `Collections` folder.
* Navigate up one level, to `~/Library/Application Support/BookMacster`.  You should see in there your `Synkmark.bmco` file.
* Open `Synkmark.bmco`.

The next three steps are optional, but recommended to reduce future confusion…

* Mouse up to the window title, and click the disclosure triangle which is to the right of the window title *Synkmark.bmco*.
* In the popover which appears, change the document name to reduce future confusion, maybe something like `My-Bookmarks.bmco`.
* In that same popover, change the document's *Where*, moving it into the `Collections` subfolder.

Continuing with required steps, 

* Click in the menu: BookMacster > Licensing > Try or Buy and either get a demo license or immediately purchase the upgrade to BookMacster.  When purchasing the upgrade to BookMacster, when it sees your Synkmark license in Synkmark's preferences still installed, it will give you a deep discount.
* Click through the Collection's *Settings* tab and verify that all are the same as you had in Synkmark's *Preferences*, or re-set as desired.

When you are happy with BookMacster and have purchased the upgrade, do not uninstall Synkmark because that may remove components which are used by BookMacster too.  Instead, do this:

* Drag Synkmark.app to the Trash
* If you want to be really neat, delete `~/Library/Preferences/com.sheepsystems.Synkmark`.

## How to Switch from BookMacster to Synkmark 

If you have been using BookMacster, have all of your desired bookmarks in a single Collection (`.bmco` file), and have decided you prefer the simpler user interface of Synkmark,

* In BookMacster, if enabled, click in the menu: *Stop all syncing now* and proceed through *Kill*.  If the *Stop all syncing now* is disabled, there is no syncing to stop, so proceed to next step.
* If not already open the Collection (`.bmco` document) which you want to migrate to Synkmark.  (Synkmark supports only a single Collection.)
* Click in that .bmco` window somewhere, to ensure that it is the active window.
* Mouse up to the window title, and click the disclosure triangle which is to the right of the window title.
* In the popover which appears, change the document name to *Synkmark.bmco*.  It must be spelled exactly like that.
* In that same popover, change the document's *Where* so that it is in the folder `~/Library/Application Support/BookMacster`.  Probably your BookMacster Collection was in the default location, `~/Library/Application Support/BookMacster/Collections`.  In that case, you only need to move it one level, out of `Collections` and into `BookMacster` which is immediately beneath `Collections`.
* Click elsewhere in the window, to dismiss the popover.
* If you have used Synkmark at some point in the past, it might ask you if you want to *Replace* the old `Synkmark.bmco`.  Presuming that is why you are here, the answer is, yes, *Replace*. 
* Quit BookMacster.
* Run Synkmark.  Verify that it automatically opens the Collection which you have renamed to `Synkmark.bmco`.  If not, stop and see what went wrong.
* Click in the menu: *Synkmark* > *Licensing* > *Try or Buy*.  If you have previously purchased a BookMacster license, click *Regular License* Synkmark and proceed to get a Synkmark license which should be at no cost.  Otherwise, you can click *Demo*, or *Regular License* if you are ready to purchase.
* Click through the tabs in Synkmark's *Preferences* and set as desired.  The settings which are associated with the document should be the same as they were in Synkmark, but the more general preferences will need to be re-set.

When you are happy with Synkmark, do not uninstall BookMacster because that may remove "helper" components which are used by Synkmark too.  Instead, do this:

* Drag BookMacster.app to the Trash.
* If you want to be really neat, delete `~/Library/Preferences/com.sheepsystems.BookMacster`.
