## Support Issues

Support issues are *our problems*, not yours.  We are grateful for all of the user feedback which has helped the continuous quality improvement of our apps.

Our [support web page](https://sheepsystems.com/support) will lead you to articles, our forum, a few troubleshooting tools and, of course, forms to contact us.

## Updating Smarky, Synkmark, Markster or BookMacster

Besides internal bug fixes, BookMacster is often updated to maintain compatibility with web browsers as they change.

We strongly recommend having updates downloaded and installed automatically.  To opt in to that, click in the [application menu](appMenu) > *Preferences* > *Updating* and check the box.  Even better, check the box to *Download and update automatically*.  Note that you can elect to receive earlier versions, called *Alpha* and *Beta*.
