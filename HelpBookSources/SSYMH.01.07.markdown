# BookMacster : Custom Usages <img src="images/BookMacster.png" class="whapp" /> [useCustom]

The prior sections give instructions explain how to configure BookMaster for the three common use cases:

* [Configure BookMacster to manage bookmarks of one Browser](useSingly)
* [Configure BookMacster to sync web browsers](useSync)
* [Configure BookMacster to use *Directly*](useDirectly)

But in fact, all BookMacster features are in fact available to all users at all times, no matter how you start.

BookMacster is a document-based application.  Your bookmarks are stored in a [Collection](bkmxDoc).  You may optionally add [local settings]() which to sync your document with web browser [clients]().  Syncing is performed by BookMacster [Syncers]().

Advanced users may choose to have more than one Collection, for example *Work Stuff* and *Home Stuff*.  You create these documents by clicking in the menu: *File* > *New Collection*.

You may want to briefly visit some of the topics linked to above.  By performing configuration steps from more than one, you can create documents that function for both Cross-Browser Syncing and *and* [using BookMacster *directly*](useDirectly).
