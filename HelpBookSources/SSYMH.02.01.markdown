# Creating a Collection <img src="images/BookMacster.png" class="whapp" /> [bkmxDocCreate]

(Smarky, Synkmark, Markster and BookMacster are all based on the [Collection](bkmxDoc).  However, only BookMacster supports more than one.  Smarky, Synkmark and Markster create and maintain your single Collection automatically.  Therefore, the *New Collection* menu item is only available in BookMacster.)

* Click in the menu: *File* > *New Collection*.

* If asked, give your new document a name that you will recognize, or accept the default name.  

* If presented with the list of candidate [Client]()(s), switch on those whose [internal bookmarks]() you want synced…

  * If you are setting up a document to [manage bookmarks of a single web browser](useSingly), switch on the *Import* checkbox for that web browsers, making it a client.  This will also switch on the *Export* checkbox.  Leave both on.
  
  * If you are setting up a document to [sync web browsers](useSync), switch on the *Import* checkbox for those web browsers, making them clients.  This will also switch on the *Export* checkbox for each.  Leave both on.
  
  * If you are setting up to purely use [BookMacster as a *Directly*](useDirectly), you will not be doing regular imports or exports and may therefore leave all checkboxes switched off.
  
The separate *Import* and *Export* checkboxes are in case you want *one-way* syncing.  To *import* means to pull changes (such as new bookmarks) from a document's [clients]() (usually, web browsers) into BookMacster for processing.  To *export* means to push changes from BookMacster out to the clients.  Usually, you want both, but if you don't, switch off the appropriate checkboxes.

* Click button *Done*.

* When asked if you want to *Import from Clients Now*, you should click *Do It* if all clients have some bookmarks you want that are not in other clients, or if you only have one Client.
