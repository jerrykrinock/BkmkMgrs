# BookMacster for One Browser <img src="images/BookMacster.png" class="whapp" /> [useSingly]

To set up BookMacster to manage the  [built-in bookmarks]() of a single web browser such as Firefox or Safari, you will create a [Collection]() with that single web browser as a [Client]().

Follow the steps below.  If you click a link for more detail, use the Back (◀) button in the toolbar to return here.

* Activate BookMacster.

* [Create a Collection](bkmxDocCreate), switching ON the checkboxes for the browser whose bookmarks you wish to manage.

* If you have other bookmarks in other files, browsers or [devices]() which you want to import and merge with what you have just imported, [copy all of them](oneTimeIxports) into your new Collection.

* [Organize your bookmarks](organizingTasks).

* Click in the menu: *File* > *Export to all*.

**You have just *manually* organized your bookmarks and you can stop here.**

But there's more, if you want.  BookMacster can keep your bookmarks in a web browser sorted automatically.  It will watch for when you change bookmarks in the web browser, imports the content, sorts it, and export it.  To enable this feature, continue…

* [Set up a Simple Syncer]().
  
* If you *Paused* syncers during the previous step, click the *Syncing* button in the toolbar to *Resume* syncing.

* This time, click *Export*.  Your initial export is very important, to make sure that the web browser and your Collection begin with the same bookmarks, that is, they begin *in sync*.

* Quit BookMacster.  [Learn Why](leaveRunning).

* If desired, you may [test your Syncer]().
