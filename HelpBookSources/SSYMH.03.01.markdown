	<tr>

		<td align="left">This indicates that no Syncers are configured in the Collection.  Clicking the button will expose the <em>Settings</em> > <em>Syncing</em> > <em>Simple</em> tab and prompt you to create a Syncer.  Because Smarky and Synkmark have Syncers built in, this *OFF* state can only appear in BookMacster.  It can also appear in BookMacster if all of your Syncers are [nonsyncing syncers]().</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center"><img src="images/ButtonSync-On.png" alt="" /></td>
		<td align="left">This indicates that Syncing is *ready*.  After you quit Smarky, Synkmark or BookMacster (or just close the <code>.bmco</code> window in BookMacster), your web Browsers (Clients) will be watched, and any future changes you make in them will be processed as you have indicated in Smarky or Synkmark's menu > *Preferences* > *Syncing*, or in BookMacster, the tabs *Settings* > *Clients* and *Syncing*.  Note that if you change bookmarks externally, for example, add a new bookmark in Safari or in Safari in a iCloud-synced iOS device while the <code>.bmco</code> window is still open, then Export, that new bookmark will be lost.  Clicking the button will cause all of this Collection's Syncers to be <em>paused</em> until you <em>resume</em> them.    The app will remind you to <em>resume</em> syncing, if you desire, before closing the window.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center"><img src="images/ButtonSync-Paused.png" alt="" /></td>
		<td align="left">This indicates that a Syncer(s) are configured, but syncing has been <em>paused</em>.  Clicking the button will <em>resume</em> syncing.</td>
