Thank you for the new photos with the tape measure, although since you measured the outside instead of the inside, we need to extrapolate what the inside measurements are.

When laying down on straps, my 120-bass accordion, which my parents bought me in 1963 when I was 7, measures in inches:

19 x 16.75 x 8.5 inches

My current beat-up case measures, on the inside, when the fuzzy liner is squished,

20 x 17.25 x 8.5

and on the outside:

21 x 18 x 9.25

and it seems to be made of 3/8 inch plywood with fuzzy liner on the inside and paper-thin ticky tacky on the outside.

The outside measurements on your photo are:




My current case may or may not be the original.  As I recall my father took me to Gus Zoppi Music Center on 8 Mile Road in Warren, MI in 1963 when I was 7, and paid $180 for this "used" accordion with nameplate "Americana".  But the inscription on the crest plate is "in cantu laetitia in sonitu longevitas", which seems to indicate a Serenelli accordion.  The only other mention I've ever seen of "Americana" was one for sale in Ferndale, MI, also an inner suburb of Detroit.  Maybe "Americana" was Gus Zoppi's house brand name for his rebuilt accordions.
