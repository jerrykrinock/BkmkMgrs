Until 2017-07-26, Xcode 9.0 Beta 4, I used the SHA-1 fingerprint, def8002d37ec43e764a8e05cf49a1552dfe91ce7, because that's the way Xcode 4 did it.  But then that stopped working.

    # The following is required for "legacy" shipments, because In -[SUAppcast connectionDidFinishLoading:],, the items parsed from the appcast are sorted descending by date.  So the newest item is first.  And then, in -[SUBasicUpdateDriverÊappcastDidFinishLoading:], we "// Find the first update we can actually use."  Now, say that I have two branches of an app, the "legacy" branch for Mac OS X 10.5 or later, and the "regular" branch for Mac OS X 10.6 or later.  Further, say I do the following (which is actually a true story with different numbers).  On April 15, publish a version 2.1 for Mac OS X 10.6 or later.  On April 16, publish a version 1.1 for Mac OS X 10.5 or later.  Then, someone with version 2.0 on Mac OS X 10.8 checks for update.  Whoops!  They will be told that "You're up to date!", because the sorting by date put version 1.1 first, 2.0 > 1.1, and 10.8 > 10.5.

# Other Uploads
    # List of other pseudo-projects which are related to this shipment.  Examples are: scripts, source code, freebies.  Each should be a directory, package or file which will be zipped and the zip archive will be uploaded.  Each such "other upload" is specified by several fields:
    #   (0) path from local Home to parent directory of the target directory or file to be uploaded
    #   (1) path from pathServerHtml to directory to which the zipped file should be uploaded
    #   (2) name of the target file as it now appears on disk.  See note [2, 3] below.
    #   (3) name to give the .zip archive, not including the .zip extension
    #   (4) an indication of whether or not the zip process should follow symbolic links, 1 if yes or 0 if no.  So following symbolic links gives you
    an easy way to include multiple subdirectories from various source locations in one archive, but takes away the ability to properly zip items which contain symbolic links that need to be transparently pass through zip/unzip, such as frameworks.
    #   (5) an indication of whether or not the pseudo-project should be codesigned with Notarized Developer ID.  1 if yes or 0 if no.
    # These four components should be separated by commas (no whitespace) and separate "other upload" items should be separated by semicolons.

Notes

[1]  Use a backslash at end of line to continue on next line.  Whitespace before the beginning of the value, after the end of the value, or after backslashes will be ignored but any other whitespace will be passed literally.

[2] In the destinations, if files are to be downloaded by visitors, avoid filenames that contain ".php", ".pl", etc. because some servers will try to execute instead of serving them, even after .zip is appended.

[3] If using punctuation to create filenames including variables, use spaces or dashes not underscores.  For example, for a zip of the app's Applescripts, name the file "$appName AppleScripts" or "$appName-AppleScripts", not "$appName_AppleScripts".  The latter will be interpreted as one variable.
